"Data analysis and selecting features.ipynb" explains how the I've picked analysed the data and picked the relevant features

"ML model.ipynb" explains how I've trained the model on sklearn's built-in Classification algorithm

"Deep_learning.ipynb" explains how I've trained the Recurrent Neural Network on Google's Cloud TPU assuming that the dataset is large and won't fit on my RAM. Link to the my trained Neural Network model - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E606JQ87vyD19pFJDn-AqJCeXRoAaqq9/view?usp=sharing

Screenshots folder consists of "validation vs loss" plots of a few RNN models I've trained by tuning various hyperparamters.
